# tilt-example-python

An example project that demonstrates how to use Tilt to develop on a Python app (built with Flask). Follow along in our [Python example project guide](https://docs.tilt.dev/example_python.html).

- [0-base](0-base): the simplest way to start
- [1-measured](1-measured): use `local_resource` to measure your deployment time
- [2-optimize-dockerfile](2-optimize-dockerfile): be sure to optimize your Dockerfile to make good use of caching
- [3-recommended](3-recommended): use `live_update` for super-fast deploys
- **Bonus**: the [debugger example](debugger-example) shows you how to use a remote Python debugger (in this case, `remote-pdb`) with your Tilt workflow
